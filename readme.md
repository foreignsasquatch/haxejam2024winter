A small game about typing your medical debt away for the HaxeJam 2024 Winter Edition. Made using Raylib and Haxe. Build the project by running the command `haxe dev.hxml`. There's a tilemap editor in the dev build of the game built it u can access by pressing `F5`, isn't used but hey its there and I spent 4hrs on that.

It's messy and really bad and unfinished.
